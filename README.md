# sails-cards

Annoyed that I couldn't find a simple flash card app that would allow tagging of categories, I decided to make my own.

Currently just for my Japanese class, so table names are specific to that, will generalize soon.

Installation:
1. Clone
2. npm install
3. Create a mysql database for this project
4. Create a config/local.js file with your mysql information that looks like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6cc63716263ca61a0af2
5. run node app.js or sails lift


UI is based on the Verti template http://html5up.net/verti
Could definitely look a lot better, but this was a quick project.  If you've got
the time, spruce it up and let me know how it turns out!
